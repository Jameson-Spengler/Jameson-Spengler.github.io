If you are looking for a show to watch, then go to HBO and checkout High-Maintenance. High-Maintenance just finished their second season and it blew their first out of the water. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a long-term show, this isn't it. High-Maintenance only has two seasons consisting of six thirty-minute episodes.

Throughout the episodes, there is only one consistent character. The main character, referred to as "The Guy", rides his bike around Brooklyn, NY delivering weed to his customers. Although, "The Guy" is the main character, the plot of each episode is not about him.

Each episode introduces the life of a different New Yorker, who happens to be a customer of "The Guy". The show does an amazing job of presenting the different lifestyles in the United States, specifically New York City. While watching the show, the viewer is able to peer into the lives of Hasidic Jews that are straying from their community, virtual reality video game creators, shut-ins and even a dog.

Before you start watching High-Maintenance on HBO, you must understand its background. High-Maintenance was not created by HBO they bought it. It started out as a web-series, that can be watched for free on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/highmaintenance/videos/page:1/sort:preset), created by Ben Sinclair, also "The Guy", and his partner Katja Blichfeld.

Ben and Katja created twenty web-episode none of which are longer than twelve minutes, it is important to watch the web-series first. They introduce characters that show up in the HBO series. High-Maintenance is a great show to watch because it's not only entertaining but also insightful into other's lifestyles.
